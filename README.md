# Grading Headache Reducer

Finished Python script that automates keeping track of student homework grades, allows us to easily export grades and comments into Canvas and/or excel. 

Used it for ~2 years, made grading much faster overall. Might revisit later and make it more user friendly so it can be passed onto future class TAs.
